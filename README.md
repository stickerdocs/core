## End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

We use the established, popular [Libsodim](https://doc.libsodium.org/) library for all data encryption. We make use of both [public-key](https://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption) and [secret-key](https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/secretbox) as well as the hashing and key derivation features from this library.
