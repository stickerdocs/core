# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We welcome responsible disclosures from security professionals via email at <support@stickerdocs.com>.

We are a micro business, so we don’t have funds to pay bounties.

We ask you to not disclose the vulnerability before it have been fixed and announced on our security page <https://stickerdocs.com/security>.

Thank you for helping us keep our customer’s data secure.
